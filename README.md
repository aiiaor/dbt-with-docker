## dbt-with-docker: A Seamless Integration for Modern Data Transformation

### About the Project:

Inspired by the classic Jaffle Shop dbt project, this repository encapsulates the power of dbt (data build tool) with the containerization abilities of Docker. The aim is to create a reusable, consistent environment that enables developers and data analysts to build, test, and deploy dbt models with ease.

### Features:

* üß∞ **dbt Integration:** Fully configured dbt environment to handle your data transformation needs.
* üö¢ **Dockerized Workflow:** Encapsulated within Docker containers for consistent development and deployment.
* üì¶ **Pre-Loaded with Sample Data:** Includes a sample data set to get you started right away.
* üõ†Ô∏è **Customizable Setup:** Easily adapt the codebase to fit your specific use case or data model.
* üìà **Quick Start Templates:** Inspired by the Jaffle Shop project, providing a jump-start for your dbt learning curve.

### Prerequisites:

* Docker installed on your machine (Download Docker)
* Git installed for cloning the repository
  
### Getting Started
* Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dbt-with-docker.git
cd dbt-with-docker
```

* Step 2: Build and Run the Docker Containers
Use Docker Compose to build and start the dbt and PostgreSQL containers:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

* Step 3: Access dbt Development Environment
Once the containers are up and running, you can access the dbt development environment within Docker:

```
docker exec -it dbt bash
```

Now you can run dbt commands within the Docker container:

```
dbt run
```

* Step 4: Connecting to PostgreSQL (Optional)
You can also connect to the PostgreSQL database running inside the Docker container using:

```
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d postgres
```
### Dataset Source
This project utilizes a retail dataset available for download from Kaggle. The dataset is used to simulate real-world retail scenarios and allows for various analyses and transformations within the dbt environment.

You can download the dataset from the following link:
